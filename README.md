The JavaScript code uses a service called "wtService" which handles the communication between the website and the YouTube and Wikipedia APIs.

The website also includes a feature to toggle between light and dark themes by clicking on a button in the footer. Additionally, the website is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout for different screen sizes using media queries.
